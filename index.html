            <h4 class="text-center">Gimme some context!</h4>
          <p>Nowadays users often possess a variety of electronic devices for
            communication and entertainment. In particular, smartphones are
            playing an increasingly central role in users' lives: Users carry
            them everywhere they go and often use them to control other
            devices. This trend provides incentives for the industry to tackle
            new challenges, such as <strong>cross-device authentication</strong>, and to develop
            new monetization schemes. A new technology based on ultrasounds has
            recently emerged to meet these demands. <strong>Ultrasound technology has a
              number of desirable features</strong>: it is easy to deploy, flexible, and
            inaudible by humans. This technology is already utilized in a
            number of different <strong>real-world applications</strong>, such as device
            pairing, proximity detection, and <strong>cross-device tracking</strong>.</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">What's the problem?</h4>
          <p>For the first time, we examine the different facets of
            ultrasound-based technology. Initially, we discuss how it is
            already used in the real world, and subsequently examine this
            emerging technology from the <strong>privacy and security perspectives</strong>. In
            particular, we first observe that the <strong>lack of OS features results
              in violations of the principle of least privilege</strong>: an app that
            wants to use this technology currently needs to require full access
            to the device microphone. We then analyse real-world Android apps
            and find that tracking techniques based on ultrasounds suffer from
            a number of vulnerabilities and are <strong>susceptible to various attacks</strong>.
            For example, we show that ultrasound cross-device tracking
            deployments can be abused to perform <strong>stealthy deanonymization
              attacks</strong> (e.g., to unmask users who browse the Internet through
            anonymity networks such as Tor), to inject fake or spoofed audio
            beacons, and to leak a user's private information.</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Where do we go from here?</h4>
          <p>Based on our findings, <strong>we introduce several defense mechanisms</strong>. We
            first propose and implement immediately deployable defenses that
            empower practitioners, researchers, and everyday users to protect
            their privacy. In particular, we introduce a <strong>browser extension</strong> and
            an <strong>Android permission</strong> that enable the user to <strong>selectively suppress
              frequencies</strong> falling within the ultrasonic spectrum. We then argue
            for the <strong>standardization of ultrasound beacons</strong>, and we envision a
            <strong>flexible OS-level API</strong> that addresses both the effortless deployment
            of ultrasound-enabled applications, and the prevention of existing
            privacy and security problems.</p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <dl>
		<dt>Am I affected?</dt>
		<dd>Likely not, unless you installed an Android app that uses an
		ultrasound-based framework and requests access to your
		microphone.</dd>

		<dt>Aren't ultrasounds bad for my health?</dt>
		<dd>We're not experts in this matter. Please refer to proper resources.</dd>

		<dt>How widespread is all this?</dt>
		<dd>We haven't performed large-scale measurements, although some of
		the apps that embed ultrasound-based frameworks were downloaded
		by hundreds of thousands users, according to the metadata published
		on the Google Play Store.</dd>

		<dt>Can this be fixed?</dt>
		<dd>Yes, but it'll take a long, long time. This is not a software
		vulnerability that can be fixed by applying a simple patch.
		Although we have created a <a
		href="#Downloads">proof-of-concept</a> patch for the Android
		Open Source Project (AOSP) and a "personal firewall" to prevent
		your browser's Web API to emit ultrasounds, a holistic action is
		needed. Decision and policy makers should agree on what's the
		next step in terms of regulations and standardization, OS vendors
		and developers should integrate support for ultrasound beacons to
		provide a transparent API (e.g., like for other physical and data
		layers such as Bluetooth), and finally developers should adopt
		such API.
		</dd>

		<dt>Is every mobile operating system capable of capturing uBeacons, or just Android?</dt>
		<dd>It depends more on the hardware of the device (i.e., the microphone) and less on the operating system. The great majority of commercial microphones found in mobile phone can capture uBeacons.
		Nevertheless, the operating system plays a role as it determines what an application can and can't do. For our research, we worked with Android and we can confirm that it is possible to listen for ultrasounds in the background.
		We haven't checked iOS, but we cannot exclude either possibilities.</dd>

		<dt>Do you have information on the actual frequencies these beacons operate on?</dt>
		<dd>We have seen frameworks listening for beacons starting from 18.000Hz and higher. For instance, a relevant patent can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20150215668">here</a>.
		However, the exact implementation of ultrasound beacons varies between companies.</dd>


		<dt>What is the situation now?</dt>
		<dd>The awesome people at City Frequencies maintain an up to date page on the current status of the ecosystem, as well as present some additional findings: <a href="https://cityfreqs.com.au/pilfer.php">Here!</a>
